# RaidTheRoot (RTR) - automated CTFd event import
# Member 1 (Platform & Architecture)
#
# Optional convenience script. Runs AFTER deploy.sh. Imports the event export
# directly inside the CTFd container using CTFd's own `import_ctf` manage
# command, so it never touches the web layer or needs a CSRF token - which is
# what made the HTTP-API approach return 403.
#
# Because the import restores the admin account that was in the export, the
# login credentials afterwards are whatever they were when the export was
# made - NOT the CTFD_ADMIN_* values in .env. Those admin values are only used
# if you set CTFd up manually in the browser first.
#
# The manual browser path (README Path B) still works; this is the automatic
# alternative.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-ctfd.sh
