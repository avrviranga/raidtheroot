"""
RaidTheRoot (RTR) - Stage 4 artefact generator
Owner: Member 3 (Challenge Design B)

Produces vault_backup.enc, the encrypted file served by the Stage 3 portal.

Scheme: repeating-key XOR. The key is the Stage 1 username in lowercase, so
the file cannot be decrypted without having solved Stage 1 - this is what
makes Stage 4 depend on two non-adjacent earlier stages.

Deterministic: same input always produces the same ciphertext. This is the
stage's reset mechanism.

Usage:
    python3 generate.py
Output:
    vault_backup.enc
